# YEN Changelog
Product updates, powered by our amazing community!

The goal withour `changelog` is to capture all of the work that we've done to build YEN, starting from the very beginning. This way we have not only a record of our collective accomplishments so we can celebrate our progress but also to increase the level of transparency into the process as we build.

We hope that you'll see many of the changes, improvements, bug fixes, and feature updates that you'll see are the **very ones** that **YOU** suggested! We love co-building with our community as it's just a better way of building.

Thank you!

## Sprint 1 (April 11-25)

The goal of this first sprint was to identify our core architecture and establish baseline goals for MVP, including:

- Core Architecture 
- Authorization + Registration 
- Create and Display Text (with or without URL post)
- Design a 3-column feed where the middle (2nd) column is dynamic (updating) with text and/or URL post 
- Coinbase oAuth Test

### Initial Concepts

- [Concept 4](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4zktb3nmioiwpk9/concept-4.jpg?dl=0)
- [Schema](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gaap2lpovv7s30p/yen-schema-draft.jpeg?dl=0)

### Authorization & Registration

Authorization/registration screen should look like: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5mgd40h0wc2picb/0-0-0_register.png?dl=0

For MVP: Registration only via email (in the future we may have google, fb, twitter, bitcoin pub accounts)

### Create and Display Text

- Only text posts and posts with URL will be accepted.
- User can add new post: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9qtulwn9fznwl4w/2-post-two.png?dl=0
- Upload up to 4 images (via drag-drog or upload)

### 3-Column Design

- 3 colums where the 2nd column is dynamic with posts. All other columns will be empty.
- LoFi: https://www.dropbox.com/s/l3naboqz83hwimz/1-0-0_feed.png?dl=0

### Coinbase oAuth Test

- US-Only: User needs to be able to connect to Coinbase via oAuth (YEN makes backend call to Coinbase API on behalf of user).I
- Success: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zjcjwcx5jhwpa9s/success.png?dl=0
