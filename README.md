# YEN Changelog
Product updates, powered by our amazing community!

The goal with our `changelog` is to capture all of the work that we've done to build YEN, starting from the very beginning. This way we have not only a record of our collective accomplishments so we can celebrate our progress but also to increase the level of transparency into the process as we build.

In this way, our `changelog` is a bit different than more traditional ones because we're going to attempt to be a bit more specific with our notes (and definitely better than just a notice that reads: "*We constantly improve our application to provide better service to our users.*"...

We hope that you'll see many of the changes, improvements, bug fixes, and feature updates that you'll see are the **very ones** that **YOU** suggested! We love [co-building with our community](https://github.com/yenio/changelog/wiki/3.-Our-CoBuilders) as it's just a better way of building.

Thank you!



## What is Your Software Development Lifecycle?

Okay, so, that's a mouthful, for sure! But, from here on out you might start learning a thing or two about the process of designing and developing great software! The `SLDC` (or also called the "Software Development Process") can look different based on the team and organization.

But what it is, essentially, is a framework of how ideas and concepts eventually become real software; it defines the tasks needed and the steps required to create working software. This often means developing a plan on how to develop, maintain, replace (or fix) the software. The **goal** is to not only produce something of value but also to help make the process, itself, better over time!

Our team specifically follows a plan that is broken down into 2 Week "Sprints" where we define the tasks we want to accomplish over those two weeks and also blocks out time to review the process itself.

Here's what this looks day-to-day:

### Week 1 (of 2)
- **Mon:** Day #3 of Sprint Cycle ("SC")
- **Tue:** Day #4 of SC
- **Wed:** Day #5 of SC
- **Thurs:** Day #6 of SC
- **Fri:** Day #7 of SC

### Week 2 (of 2)
- **Mon:** Day #8 of SC // Sprint Planning (Plan goals for next sprint, assign tasks)
- **Tue:** Day #9 of SC // Business Requirements (Decide technical solutions matching business logic with engineering requirements) // Code Freeze â€“ "`Cinderella Deploy`" (changes allowed up until midnight PST)
- **Wed:** Day #10 of SC // Deploy to Development / Staging Branches
- **Thurs:** Day #1 of New SC // Master Deploy from Staging to Live // Sprint Retrospective // Goals for Next Sprint
- **Fri:** Day #2 of New SC

You'll notice that we start a new Sprint Cycle on the 2nd Thursday of the 2nd week. 

We plan on adding more context and material around our technical workflows over time but we hope you have learned a thing (or two) and find this type of thing not only interesting but perhaps even useful for your own projects (and those projects don't have to necessarily technical in nature)!

Without further ado... here's what our Sprints have looked like historically and the larger tasks that we attempted to work through!
